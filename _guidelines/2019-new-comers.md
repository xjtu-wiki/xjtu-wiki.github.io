**Tips:**: Here's a recommended order in the first day: Dorm -> Phone number -> Register -> Bank account 

### Before the registration 
Check into your reserved dormitory first. Registration (at the SIE) is not the first thing you should do. 

#### 1. Get a SIM card
* Option 1A: CHINA UNICOM (@Shop): Go to China Unicom service shop with your passport and apply for a sim card. The account must be charged with 200 RMB at the beginning of service. Some of the staff can speak minimum English. 
* Option 1B: CHINA UNICOM (@Dorm - Xing Qing): You can find a booth on the ground floor of West 8 and 13 dormitory. You can get your SIM card there as well. They are here especially for international students. 
* Option 1C: CHINA UNICOM (@Dorm - Innovation Harbour) - Unconfirmed
* Option 2: CHINA MOBILE: Go to China Mobile shop near ICBC Bank on the campus. *(further instruction needed)*

#### 2. Residence police verification and registration
**For on-campus living:** 
- Xing Qing Campus: Register at the West 13 dormitory (alternative name: building 25). 
- Innovation Harbour: Building B5/B6, international student dormitory.

**For off-campus living (except Innovation Harbour):** On arrival you must register your residency within 24hrs at the nearest police station, because you will need a slip from the police for your registration process. 

**Temporary hotel stays:** The hotel reception should handle the residence registration automatically for you. 

#### 3. Make three photocopies of your documents. Then, proceed to registration ;) 

### Registration 
Location: SIE
