Getting from the airport to the main campus could be challenging since there is no direct public transportation line that you could use. If you have a lot of stuff with you, it is recommended that you get a taxi. If you pack lightly, you may use the airport shuttle bus in combination with buses. If you are newly arrived, there is a free WiFi available in the airport so that you can contact the driver.
