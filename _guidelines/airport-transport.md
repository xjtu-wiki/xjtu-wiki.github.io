**WARNING: This guideline is not complete**
Getting from the airport to the main campus could be challenging since there is no direct public transportation line that you could use. If you have a lot of stuff with you, it is recommended that you get a taxi. If you pack lightly, you may use the airport shuttle bus in combination with buses. If you are newly arrived, there is a free WiFi available in the airport so that you can contact the driver. 

## Railway
This should be the most convenient way to travel to and from the airport. However, there is a limitation in baggage size that you can take with you. The airport railway was opened in September 2019.
