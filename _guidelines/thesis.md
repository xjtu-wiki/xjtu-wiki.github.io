This is an unofficial and general guideline on how to proceed with the thesis writing, defense, and degree application. 

## Important note
There are two main parties where you can confirm the procedure for your particular case of thesis defense and graduation process. 
1. The supervisor
2. The school

## Material needed
- Submission deadline (issued by each school)
- Thesis draft (download files [below]())
- Degree application form (download files [below](#xjtu-thesis-template)) <br />
(including thesis defense material)

## Thesis formatting
The thesis formatting must comply with Xi'an Jiaotong University format. The official and unofficial template can be founded below. 

## XJTU thesis template

1. Microsoft Word's template
2. Latex template
3. Translations of school's and major's names

### Note about formatting 
- The format has been changed since 2018. Any format files older than that should not be used. 

### Pitfalls and how to avoid them
- LaTeX template has proven to be useful. 
- If you don't know how to use Word, it's a good time to learn it. 
- If you are using Word version of the template, use the automatic formatting. 
- XJTU uses a Chinese national citation style called **GB/T-7714-2015**, it is standardized. There are many plugins for citation tools such as EndNote, Mendeley, and LaTeX package. 

## Degree application 
The procedure for filling out degree application forms is different for each school. 

### For School of Electronic and Information Engineering (EIE)

- The form should be used with hard copy files provided by the school. If you don't get one, contact Yin Laoshi or a representative.
