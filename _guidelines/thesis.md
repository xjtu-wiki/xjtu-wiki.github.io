#### Note about formatting 
- The format has been changed since 2018. Any format files older than that should not be used. 

#### Pitfalls and how to avoid them
- LaTeX template has proven to be useful. 
- If you don't know how to use Word, it's a good time to learn it. 
- If you are using Word version of the template, use the automatic formatting. 
- XJTU uses a Chinese national citation style called **GB/T-7714-2015**, it is standardized. There are many plugins for citation tools such as EndNote, Mendeley, and LaTeX package. 

## Degree application 
The procedure for filling out degree application forms and graduation is different for each school. In some schools, the procedure would be different from department from department.
